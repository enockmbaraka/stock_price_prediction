Stock Price Prediction



## Stock Market Price Estimation

Stock market price estimation is a crucial aspect of financial analysis that impacts investors, companies, and analysts alike. The goal is to achieve accurate and reliable results to guide decision-making and minimize risks.

Inaccurate estimations can lead to:

- **Investor Losses:** Misleading predictions may cause poor investment decisions.
- **Market Panic:** Overly pessimistic forecasts can trigger unnecessary sell-offs.
- **Reputational Risk:** Financial institutions or analysts may lose credibility.



## Data collection

I used the [ ```yfinance```](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file) library to download stock market price data for four companies—Google, Meta, Apple, and NVIDIA—from October 30, 2021, to October 30, 2024. The yfinance library is a Python tool for accessing historical market data, financial metrics, and company information from [Yahoo!Ⓡ finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/).

You can download the data in two steps as outlined below:


1) Specify the companies.
```tickers = ['GOOGL', 'META', 'AAPL', 'NVDA']```
2) Decide on the start and end dates, then download the data.
```stock_data = yf.download(tickers, start="2021-10-30", end="2024-10-30", group_by="ticker")```
